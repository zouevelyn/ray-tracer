What does this code do?

It declares a composite action. The composite action allows you to bundle multiple workflow steps into a single action, combining multiple run commands into a single reusable action.
It creates a new build environment and sets up Node.js 20 there.
It installs npm dependencies and uses a caching mechanism to speed up this process.
These are the most important parts of the setup-node action. Now, let's move on to the last action, which is publish.
